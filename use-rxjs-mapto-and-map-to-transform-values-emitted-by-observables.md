# Use RxJS mapTo and map to Transform Values Emitted by Observables

Transforming the values emitted by observables. We made our first operator called multiplyBy, which looks a bit useful, but in practice we don't need it because it's too specific: it only does simple multiplication on numbers. In this lesson we will see how the map\(\) operator is useful for any calculation on delivered values.
